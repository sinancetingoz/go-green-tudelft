Meeting notes
============
18/02/2019

## Questions:

1. Is sockets best way to setup server? Anything better?
2. Difference between branches and feature branches.
3. Scrum this week?
4. Checkstyle

## TA notes:

1. Don't use ServerSockets, will take a longer time. Find framework that does it for you(Spring?).
2. For every new feature create branch. Branch name should be somewhat descriptive of feature.
3. Yes, every monday make a sprint for that week.
4. Run maven target, get extra folder that gives report. Screenshot that and give to TA.
