# Notes for meeting 5
> 18 March 2019

## Points of discussion:

- Improve user experience
- start implementing the neccasary features for the last demo
- Discuss what features we will implement for the last demo
- ask clinton about the cherry picking for the remote server
- is it worth it to use neoj4 in conjunction with postgresql
- daily tip implementation discussed
- graphing the points you get each day and comparing them to your friends
- encryption on database
- 

## Conclusions

- Add the unwanted folders to the git ignore on the remote_server branch
- we should think about scallability in case andy asks about it, neo4j is better for using multiple servers, but harder to implement
- daily tip could be generated by generating it when the server restarts
- daily tip only generated for active users(pottentialy)
- encryption on database is tediouse with testing
