Sprint review week 6
In the GUI part we worked on a nice looking and easy-to-use visual interface:
-We used icons instead of tabs with titles for the categories (transportation, food, energy).
-We moved to removed the log out button from the main tabs and used a small icon in the corner which directly logs out.
-We added more options on all categories (food types, transportation types, energy saving devices).
-We enlarged the application window because it was too small.
On the server side:
-We worked on adding points on every data type inside all categories.
-We tested the new features.
No important changes were made on the database side.
Next week, we should work on the following:
On GUI:
-Find a reliable library for adding and comparing statistics.
-We could add profile pictures for better visualization.
-Make icons more clear to understand.
-Create friend request tab/screen.
On server side:
-Find a match between CO2 emission and points.
On database:
-If profile pictures will be added, work on storing an image in the database.
