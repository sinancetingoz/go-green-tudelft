What we managed to do:
1. We already don't have any problems with git;
2. Managed to make a working login system with communication between server and client;
3. Made a plan for the database part;
4. We have a gui Design;
5. First tests for server and client.


What we would have wanted to be done but didn't manage to achieve:
1. Create the database and connect it to the server;
2. Take a look at Continuous Integration.
