During week 4 

On server side:

-We succesfully created a database that is running remotely
all data sent by the client is persistent
Further improvement: we are still making research on the
most efficient way to test the database. We are also focusing on figuring it out

-We succesfully organised the code in Dao-Service-Controller structure
Our code looks cleaner. We also used Mockito to test Service and Controller
by mocking Dao.

On client side:

-The first version of simple gui came to light. It looks the way we designed it
There is not yet much interaction between it and the server. 

Further improvement: make it communicate with the sever
