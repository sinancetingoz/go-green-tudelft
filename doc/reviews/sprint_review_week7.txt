Sprint review week 7
In the GUI part we again worked on better user experience with trying to make it a nicer looking and easy-to-use interface:
-We worked on making more clear which category is selected by dimming the unselected categories.
-We implemented the statistics chart to compare points with friends.
-We made our Go Green logo better quality.
-Friend requests can be sent with a nice looking interface and the friend search bar guesses the possible users after there is some input.

On the server we worked on:
-Deleting friend requests from database when a person declines the friend request.
-Connecting the power saved by solar panels activity to server.
-Checkstyle and coverage report.

On database:
-We added a new column for profile pictures which takes a type called BYTEA, which is useful to store images.
-Added the points gained for saving energy with solar panels in the database.

Next week, on GUI:
-We will try to add profile picture interface while creating the user and in the profile section.
-Work on better visualization

On server:
-We will implement lowering the temperature.
-We will implement groceries.
-We will write the tests for profile picture feature.

On database:
-We will work retrieving the stored image from the database.
-We will create the last table for the database.
