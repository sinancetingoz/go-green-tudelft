Sprint review week 5

GUI:
During week 5 we mainly focused on having a minimal gui for
adding activities and visualising them later.
It took as we expected. However, for the next following weeks we are going
to focus on creating a more enjoyable experience for the user.
So this week: 

-we are going to switch from buttons to icons so that user can understand better
the way our app works.
-we are going to explore the way graphs can be plotted (for statistics)
-we should also create GUI parts for accepting and sending friend requests
-create add-activity screens perfectly crafted to particular activities

Server:
During week 5 we also focused on having everything set up for demo 2.
As most of the interaction with the database was already set, we only
had to organise code better, deal with exceptions and test the three layers
DAO,service and controller. Just few paths were added, while most of them
just had to be set up to respond to the sessionId.
This week we have to:
-make sure all the three types of activities can be submitted
correctly
-focus on getting the most valuable data for statistics page and
for the tip function.
-have a smooth connection between the data needed by client and the data server
responses with.
-test all the new features that will be added
-we have to populate the "localDb" with the activities the user can add.


Database:
We created an empty database we are using for testing. We expect to not have any further changes 
in the database part as everything works fine.
