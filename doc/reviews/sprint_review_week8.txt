Sprint review week 8

# Client:
During this week the a lot of improvements were made for the UI of our project:
The user is now able to see his progress bar and his latest activities (also able to filter them). 
All the buttons and the choiceBoxes are styled.
All the friends and their total points are shown on the friends page

# Server:
Made all the connect classes inherit from an abstract class Connect (the code is cleaner)
Tested the DefaultValue layers. 
Programmed the logic of installing solar panels (when server restarts points are added)

# Final report
We wrote the first draft of the final report and received feedback

# Further:
We should focus on making the code as modular as possible(remove duplicate and redundant code)
Try to use threads so the user does not feel the app slowing down.
Implement recover password (send email with special link)
Make tests with only one assert per test
Improve the final report
