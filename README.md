Strong points
- I tend to be able to focus for a long time and finish something, even if it takes the whole day
- I feel very motivated and dedicated to get a project done
- Some experience in creating applications for myself and as an assignment

Weak points
- Quite bad at planning and time management
- Good at postponing my work
- I generally try to create more than is intended, making it overcomplicated

Goals
- Learning how to work with a team, scrum specifically
- Learning to be really comfortable with git
- Designing an actual product and making it all fit together
- Overall becoming a better programmer, working with different libraries

Interests:
I hope to work mainly on the backend of the application,
dealing with databases and handling requests and responses
from the client application on the server side.

Goals:
- Understand how to put together small different software pieces
- Understand all the important technologies needed for creating a fully functional software
- Be a member of a pretty large team, a bring the right contributions to it
- Get used to deadlines, and other managerial things involved in a large project

Strong points:
- A good understanding of the way algorithms work and how to make the most out of them
depending on the needs
- A strong mathematical foundation
- Some experience in creating a piece of software from the scratch

Weaker points:
- I sometimes skip steps just to finish stuff faster.
- I am not always patient and I loose my motivation if things are getting crazy
- I am usually against using libraries in Java preferring to write the entire piece of code on my
own. But this time I should listen to Andy and start looking for useful packages/libraries.


Conclusion: I wish us luck and I feel that there is no way this project could go wrong as long as we 
stick to the guidelines and listen to each other.

Goals:
- Learn how to work efficient with a team
	I've worked together in high school on several small projects. But we never used specific methods nor programs (like git) to do this efficiently.
- Learn to deliver a complete product; combine everything we learned
	So far I've only done tasks seperately. For example created a game on web, tasks on database and created a specific Java app (OOP). Fitting all of these together is one of my goals.
- Become a better programmer on all sides
	All the programming experience I have, are gained through this course. I hope to develop them throughout the project.

In order to reach my goals I'd like to help building features on both backend and frontend. 
Furthermore, I'd like to take part a lot in the overall organisation and communication of the group. 
I am also interested in design, so I would like to implement a bit of that as well.

Strong points:
I’m good at working in groups
-	I had a class in high school where we had to do projects in groups, so I learned working together and doing your own tasks while communicating with group members.
-	In a team working together is very important so being good at that will help the team a lot.
Good at learning new stuff online
-	In my high school projects I had to learn a lot of new skills online like working with an Arduino or making an android app.
-	If someone in a team can easily learn new skills it is helpful for him and also for teammates because he can help them understand it.
Weaker points:
Sometimes I don’t speak up enough
-	Sometimes if I have an idea I won’t speak up so the idea doesn’t get heard even though it could be a good idea. Usually I just overthink stuff and decide not to say it which is not good.
-	If someone in a team has good ideas but doesn’t speak up, those ideas will go to waste.
I go to far in stuff that is probably not reachable and too difficult instead of choosing the easier route which sometimes is not worth it and wastes time.
-	In a project in high school I worked the first 4 of the 8 weeks on something very difficult which ended not working. That wasted a lot of time.
-	If I waste a lot of time on one thing which I don’t end up using I will be less valuable to my team.

GROW
GOAL
-	I want to learn to speak up and learn how to make important decisions in a team.
-	Working on big projects will include a lot of important decisions to be made and if I want my opinion to be heard I have to learn to speak up and contribute to the decision.
-	If by the end of the project I can look back at some of the big decisions and reflect if I contributed to them.
Reality
-	I am trying to speak more and just say what’s on my mind even though it may not always be right. Even it is not right, I get corrected and learn something.
Options
-	I can try to lead conversations and start the conversation for important decisions. That should make it easier to have a bigger voice in decisions.
Will
-	To achieve my goal I just have to do it. It might be hard in the beginning but I will get used to it and it will get easier.

Goals to achieve:
-	Working as a team: Everyone of us will have to do their part without procrastinating in order to progress smoothly. As this will be a long process, presumably after a few weeks things are going to become more difficult, so the whole group needs to motivate each other. Also most certainly, all of us will have strengths and weaknesses on different parts of the project, so we will need to help each other out in those circumstances.
-	Speaking up and communicating: A thing that will help us in the future is speaking up and showing our contribution during a teamwork. If all of us put our ideas into words and not hold them in us, we will understand our ways of thinking a lot faster, find a common idea that all of us would like to work on, and most importantly, the group members will feel closer to each other, making the teamwork fun and more efficient. I hope to achieve that during this project.
-	Becoming better programmers: During the last 2 quarters, we did not have a chance to program Java language with our fellow students. This project gives us the chance to learn things together and share our programming knowledge with each other. Presumably all of us have some deficiencies in different parts of programming, and by sharing our knowledge we may fill in those deficiencies.

Strong point:
-	I played in some music bands which needed a lot of teamwork for a long period of time, so I am experienced about working as a team in long periods of time, and I am pretty sure that if all of us work without procrastinating this project will work smoothly.

Weak point:
-	I did't have any programming experience before coming to TU Delft, so I am still not a confident programmer.

I have 2 learning goals I would like to achieve during this course:
1.	I would like to understand what it means to work on a project with a team and to have deadlines for certain aspects of the project. I’m guessing this is the way programmers in companies are supposed to work and I hope the course really teaches us how to manage doing this;
2.	I would also like to improve my programming skills throughout this course. Up until now I have programmed only data structures, algorithms and “applications” needed for the Computer Exam of OOP. But I don’t think that this is what real-life programs need to do. I guess they need to be easy to read and understand from the users, i.e. having a good GUI and to not crash if something is typed wrong from the user, i.e. having a well-thought structure and being tested multiple times.

I have worked in a team on multiple occasions – I was a part of a Mathematics team competitions a few years ago and I was also a part of a dancing group throughout my school life (where teamwork is essential in order for the dance to look nice). But I have never worked on a team project that takes more than a week and needs so much documentation (besides the coding). So I think this will be a bit of a challenge.
I was also programming a lot of algorithms since I was an Informatics competitor for about 5 years. But in these competitions time and space efficiency was pretty much everything we were asked to think about. While in this project I think the most important aspect of the program is to be easy to understand and to be easy to use. So, since I have never programmed a GUI and a working server before, I guess I’ll need to learn how to do that.

I am really motivated to research and work really hard in order for this project to be a success. After talking with my teammates I understood that they are really motivated as well, so I hope we can make the perfect application. We will be helping each other a lot and I am sure that after the end of quarter 3 all of us would have become better programmers and would know much more about programming in Java than before.
